- Completely redesigned the mockup from top to bottom. The design language has changed to a simplified and further minimalized layout. Colors has been changed to incorporate no more than 4, and the site has been combinded into one long landing page.
- Frame work research is being done, and it has come down to Skeleton, and Milligram.Both are lightweight, reponsive, and fast. I am leaning towards Skeleton as its barebones functionality is all I need for my minimal website.
