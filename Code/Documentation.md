- Complete redesigned of mockup sketch from top to bottom. The design language has changed to a simplified and further minimalized layout. Colors have been changed to incorporate no more than 4, and the site has been combined into one main landing page.
- Framework research is being done, and it has come down to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), and [Milligram](https://milligram.io/). Both are lightweight, reponsive, and fast. I am leaning towards Skeleton as its barebones functionality is all I need for my minimalist website.
