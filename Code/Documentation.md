- Complete redesigned of mockup sketch from top to bottom. The design language has changed to a simplified and further minimalized layout. Colors have been changed to incorporate no more than 4, and the site has been combined into one main landing page.
- Framework research is being done, and it has come down to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), and [Milligram](https://milligram.io/). Both are lightweight, reponsive, and fast. I am leaning towards Skeleton as its barebones functionality is all I need for my minimalist website.

- I choose Skeleton Boilerplate as it suits all my needs and is relatively popular.
- I decided to use both black and white versions of my site. The theme will change depending on if the browser is in [light](UserInterface/Images/personal_website_lightv2.png) or [dark](UserInterface/Images/personal_website_dark_v2.png) mode. This will done through simple javascript.
- Downloaded Skeleton and will soon start work on the nav bar.
